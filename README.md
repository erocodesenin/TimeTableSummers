# TimeTableSummers
Wasting a lot of time, time table to keep track of both course and competitive programming.

I have a data strucures and algorithms course going on currently and I also do competitive programming, as both the things go hand and hand, it will be pretty beneficial for me if I can do both of them equally well.


## How will this HELP!!!!

If I could end up doing the course well and also become an Expert on Codeforces by the end of summers, it will be pretty good for me and my ICPC team, my teammates are both experts and I dont want to be the one to hold them back.


Also will help me get good at the stuff I am aching to get good at, that is, Competitive Programming.

The course will help me with JOBS as well as Competitive Programming.



##The Plan


2 hours each day for the course - watch videos, when done with videos, use the time to solve exercise.


Atleast 4 hours each day for competitive programming, If  you dont do do it, you will regret like you did while JEE.
